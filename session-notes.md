## Key Findings

### 1. Fish Oil Price Drop
- S&S mgmt page shows $48.81 but product page shows **$45.01** S&S
- Saving $3.80/order = $15.20/year (every 3 months)
- May already be applied automatically to next delivery

### 2. Gillette Arctic Ice: Switch singles to 3-pack
- Currently buying 8 individual units at $11.02 each = **$88.16/delivery**
- 3-pack S&S is $30.57 = $10.19/unit
- If switched to 3 × 3-pack = 9 units for $91.71 (one extra unit)
- Or 2 × 3-pack + 2 singles = 8 units for $83.18
- **Potential savings: ~$5-7 per delivery**

### 3. Duplicate Lavazza Espresso Subscriptions
- Item 37: Lavazza Espresso single 2.2lb - $19.54/mo
- Item 43: Lavazza Espresso 2-pack 2.2lb - $34.19/mo
- Item 44: Lavazza Espresso single 2.2lb - $19.54/mo
- **You're getting 4 bags/month ($73.27).** Is that intentional?
- 2-pack at $34.19 = $17.10/bag is cheaper than singles at $19.54/bag
- Could save $4.88/mo ($58.56/year) by switching to 2× 2-pack instead

### 4. Duplicate Febreze AIR Subscriptions
- Item 6: Active at $18.94
- Item 24: UNAVAILABLE (same product)
- Should cancel the unavailable duplicate

### 5. No Coupons Found
- None of the checked items had active coupons on their product pages

### 6. Overall Assessment
- S&S discounts are genuine (5-15% below one-time prices)
- No items found where one-time purchase is cheaper than S&S
- Main savings opportunities: consolidate Lavazza to 2-packs, switch Gillette Arctic Ice to 3-packs

## Changes Made (2026-02-26)

### 1. Skipped unavailable Febreze from March 10 delivery
- Item 24 (FBRZ AIR Linen&Sky, UNAVAILABLE) skipped for this delivery

### 4. Increased Lavazza Espresso 2-pack quantity to 2 (Item 43)
- subscriptionId: SNST0_044D5812E04A4519ACC1
- Changed from 1 → 2 units, still every 1 month

- subscriptionId: SNSA0_XGZGQKXRZGAKPHPHVR96
- Was a duplicate of the active Febreze subscription (SNSA0_06QM1FCESTM2EEGFDZC0)
- Reason: "This was created by accident"
- The active subscription (Item 6, $18.94, every 6 months) remains

### 6. Gillette Arctic Ice 3-pack switch — NOT DONE
- No Clinical Soft Solid Arctic Ice 3-pack available via Amazon's "Switch product" feature
- Only option was a non-Clinical Clear Gel variant (different formulation)
- Left as-is: 8 singles × $11.02 = $88.16 every 6 months
- Revisit if Amazon adds a Clinical Arctic Ice 3-pack in the future
